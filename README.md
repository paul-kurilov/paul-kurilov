### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul Kurilov, a web developer from Folsom, USA. I love programming both as a job and as a hobby and I spend a lot of time writing code and testing out new ideas. I very love startups and innovative technologies. I work mainly with web technologies such as React, JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS and SCSS.
